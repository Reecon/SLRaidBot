Keeps track of channel you raid/host and channels that raid/host you.
You can also add channel manually.

The UI sorts your potential raid targets in reverse order of when you raided/hosted them last and shows which channel are currently online.

### Setup
* For the initial setup rename `clientid.conf.example` to `clientid.conf` and replace the line with your client id.
* Insert the API Key file in the bot's script menu
